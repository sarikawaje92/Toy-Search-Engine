# Toy-Search-Engine

Project Description:
Implement a toy "search engine". More specifically, you code will read a corpus and produce TF-IDF vectors for documents in the corpus. Then, given a query string, you code will compute the cosine similarity between the query vector and the document vectors and return the document that gets the highest similarity score.

Dataset:
We use a corpus of all the general election presidential debates from 1960 to 2012. We processed the corpus and provided you a .zip file, which includes 30 .txt files. Each of the 30 files contains the transcript of a debate and is named by the date of the debate.
